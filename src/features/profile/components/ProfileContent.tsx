      <p>
        I'm the Co-Founder and CEO of Cynco, an AI startup rethinking how accounting technology is built.
        Before our launch, we pitched at the Digital Adoption Awards by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants and received a recognition award. We were named one of the top three companies at PACE Bootcamp by Artem Ventures and ranked in the top five at the MyStartup Pre-Accelerator by Cradle Fund and WTF Accelerator.

      <p>
        Before Cynco, I ran a chartered accounting firm advising multinational companies, worked as an auditor, and served as a Fractional CFO across the APAC region.
        In total, I've worked with over 500 companies across industries â€” seeing firsthand how accounting systems break and what scaling companies really need.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of accounting, I co-founded and co-invested in F&B, retail, fashion, and real estate businesses alongside other syndicates.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I build because I love it. Over the years, I picked up design, coding, and sales to build faster and better.
        I'm an accountant, consultant, and occasional vibe coder who turned into a founder determined to make an impact.
