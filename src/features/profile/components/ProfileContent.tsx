        I'm the co-founder of Cynco. We're building the AI-native accounting infrastructure — rethinking how financial data flows, from ingestion to reporting. It's built not just for firms, but for operators, founders, and anyone who works with numbers and decisions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Most accounting tools were designed for another era — slow, manual, and backward-looking. We're building from first principles: real-time, automated, and built around how data actually moves today.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Before Cynco, I ran a chartered firm and worked with 500+ companies. I saw how much time was lost wrangling data instead of advising. We're changing that.

        I'm an accountant turned founder who learn to writes code, designs workflows, and ships product.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of accounting, I co-founded and co-invested in F&B, retail, fashion, and real estate businesses alongside other syndicates.
