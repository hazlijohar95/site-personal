# Scaling Open Accounting

It's been just over a year since we launched Cynco's first public API. What began as a simple connector for bank data has evolved into a comprehensive open accounting platform. Here's what we've learned along the way.

## Technical Challenges

Scaling an open financial system presents unique technical challenges. Financial data isn't just big—it's complex, sensitive, and highly regulated.

### Data Volume

One of our early customers—a mid-sized e-commerce company—processes over 10,000 transactions daily. This might not sound like "big data" compared to social networks or streaming services, but financial transactions require absolute precision and consistency.

We moved from a traditional relational database to a hybrid approach:

```typescript
// Our hybrid data architecture
interface TransactionStore {
  // High-volume, recent transactions in a time-series optimized store
  recent: TimeSeriesDB<Transaction>;
  
  // Historical data in a columnar data warehouse
  historical: ColumnStore<Transaction>;
  
  // Metadata and relationships in a graph database
  relationships: GraphDB<TransactionRelationship>;
}
```

This architecture gives us the flexibility to handle different query patterns efficiently while maintaining data integrity.

## Integration Ecosystem

Open accounting only works if it connects with the tools businesses already use. We've integrated with:

- 37 banking providers
- 12 accounting packages
- 8 tax preparation systems
- 24 e-commerce platforms

Each integration taught us something new about the messy reality of financial data. Bank statements don't always match merchant records. Accounting categories differ between systems. Time zones create reconciliation headaches.

We've built an extensive normalization layer that transforms data into a consistent format while preserving its original fidelity.

## Building Trust

Perhaps the biggest challenge in scaling hasn't been technical at all—it's been building trust. When you're handling someone's financial data, technical excellence is necessary but not sufficient.

We've invested heavily in:

1. **SOC 2 Compliance**: Completing our Type II audit within 8 months of launch
2. **Transparent Pricing**: No hidden fees or unexpected costs
3. **Open Source Components**: Publishing key parts of our stack for community review
4. **Human Support**: Real financial experts available to help with complex issues

## What's Next

As we enter our second year, we're focused on two major initiatives:

1. **Embedded Finance**: Allowing our customers to offer financial services directly within their own products
2. **Predictive Insights**: Using historical patterns to help businesses forecast future trends

I'm more convinced than ever that open accounting is the future. The financial ecosystem has been closed for too long, and the benefits of openness are too compelling to ignore.

In my next post, I'll dive deeper into how we're thinking about AI and machine learning in the context of financial data. Until then, I'd love to hear about your experiences with financial system integration.
