# How I Started Cynco

When I first conceived of Cynco, I wasn't thinking about building a company. I was trying to solve a problem that had bothered me for years: why is financial data so siloed and inaccessible?

## The Beginning

After spending five years working at various fintech startups, I noticed a pattern. While these companies were innovating in many areas, they were all building walled gardens around their data. This made it nearly impossible for businesses to get a comprehensive view of their finances without significant manual effort.

```js
// The traditional approach
const financialData = {
  bank: { /* data locked in bank systems */ },
  accounting: { /* data locked in accounting software */ },
  taxes: { /* data locked in tax software */ }
};

// What we needed
const openFinancialData = {
  ...financialData,
  accessible: true,
  interoperable: true
};
```

## The Open Accounting Principle

This led me to develop what I call the "Open Accounting Principle": financial data should be accessible, interoperable, and under the control of its owners. This isn't just a technical philosophy—it's about empowering businesses with their own information.

### Key Principles:

1. **Data Accessibility**: Your financial data should be available to you in formats you can use
2. **Interoperability**: Systems should talk to each other without expensive middleware
3. **User Control**: You should decide how your data is used and shared
4. **Transparency**: Financial processes should be understandable, not black boxes

## Building the MVP

With these principles in mind, I started building a prototype on nights and weekends. Initially, it was just a simple API that could connect to bank accounts and categorize transactions. But even this basic version demonstrated the power of the concept.

Our first user was a small bakery that had been manually copying data between their point-of-sale system, bank statements, and accounting software. With our tool, they saved about 10 hours of work each month—time they could spend actually baking!

## Looking Forward

As Cynco continues to grow, we remain committed to these founding principles. Open accounting isn't just a feature of our product—it's our reason for existing.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into how we're implementing these ideas and the challenges we've faced along the way.

Until then, I'd love to hear your thoughts on open accounting. Have you experienced the frustration of siloed financial data? What solutions have you found?
